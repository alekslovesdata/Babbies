'''
Hi! This is a pretty lazily written script that will generate a first and middle name based on some values you can
configure within the code. There's comments above most lines explaining what they do.

This was written on Python 3.6 but should be 3.x compatible (probably 2.x also)
You'll need to have SQLAlchemy

Names were taken from here: https://github.com/hadley/data-baby-names
They were then converted to the baby_names_database.db for easy querying with SQLAlchemy
